BWA3 Realism
============

A modular realism mod for Arma 3, partly based on Taosensai's work.


## Philosophy

*   **Open Source**  
Everyone is free to fork this and make contributions.
*   **Modular Setup**  
Disable/Delete features you don't want.  
*Due to the amount of .pbos you cannot toggle the features in the in-game expansions menu to avoid clutter, but have to be removed from the modfolder manually. Sorry.*  
*   **No Bullshit**  
No gimmicky features that don't add anything to gameplay and are out of place in Arma.  
*(And if there is a feature that you consider unneccessary, just disable it!)*

## Features

*   Improved Medical System
*   Realistic names for vehicles and weapons
*   Backblast
*   Realistic ballistics including wind and humidity
*   Weapon resting
*   Interaction with civilians

and more
